# A New Hybrid Scheduling Algorithm for Enhancement of CPU Performance

Most of the existing CPU scheduling algorithms are not applicable in real-time environment due to major limitations
like high in turnaround time, waiting time, and response time, also high context switches and less throughput. Our main aim is
to provide a new hybrid CPU Scheduling algorithm that can enhance the CPU performance in a real-time environment. We have
designed hybrid version of algorithm by integrating Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN) and standard deviation (SD)
scheduling algorithms. It combines the strengths of standard deviation, elimination of starvation, and HRRN priority
scheduling. It assigns different priorities to processes thereby dealing with aging issue. Thus, our algorithm corrects major
limitations of the existing CPU scheduling algorithms. We'll also provided a comparative analysis of our proposed new hybrid
algorithm with the prevailing scheduling algorithms based on average turnaround, average waiting time, varying time quantum,
and many context switches.
